# Flutter Doctor Appointment App ü©∫

A modern, full-featured **Doctor Appointment Booking App** built with Flutter. This project enables users to browse doctors by specialty, view doctor profiles, book appointments, and manage their medical interactions efficiently. It combines a sleek UI with essential functionalities that are ideal for telemedicine startups, hospitals, or independent healthcare professionals.

The project demonstrates best practices in Flutter development, including modular architecture, state management with BLoC and Cubit, REST API integration with Dio and Retrofit, dependency injection using GetIt, and support for localization and theming. With persistent storage, real-time updates, and rich UI elements such as shimmer effects and SVG graphics, the app delivers a seamless user experience across Android, iOS, and web platforms.
